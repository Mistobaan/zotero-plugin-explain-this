This repository contains a plugin for Zotero, a free and open-source reference management software.

The plugin enhances Zotero's functionality by allowing users to highlight text within a document and request an explanation of the selected text from an OpenAI compatible Large Language Model (LLM) endpoint. This provides a quick and integrated way to get definitions and explanations of complex topics while reading research papers and other documents within Zotero.
